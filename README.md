## 📈 Generating the Results

This section describes how you can generate the final results *from the already generated reports* for all the projects. All the scripts are tested with Python 3.9.1(latest). All the steps should be performed inside `scripts/` directory.


### Step 0: Resolving Dependencies

Make sure you have Python3 installed. We use some Python libraries during the automation/processing of our data. The are all listed in the `scripts/requiremens.txt` file. Run the following command the install the dependencies:

 ````shell
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ````

### Step 1: Preprocessing Data

It splits the dataset from a single file to project wise `.csv` files, that we use later on. It generates the `.csv` files in `scripts/dataset_split/` directory. You can omit this step if you want, since we have already have added the results folder.

```shell
python3 json_preprocess.py
```

### Step 2: Calculating the Results

Final step is calculate the percentage of bugs in the covered and uncovered parts as well as the percentage coverage. To do this, run the following command:

```shell
./evaluate_all.sh repo_list.txt
```

`repo_list.txt` contains the links for the repos against which the reports exist. This script clones them and process them further to get the results. The results are then saved in `results.csv` file. We have included it in out repo.

We further process it to remove outliers, we have saved our processed `.csv` file in `scripts/results_manually_processed.csv`.

Please note that it will clone the repos in the `scripts/repos/` folder from GitHub.

### Step 3: Finding Correlation

We find the correlation in Excel. For this, we use the following formula:

```
=CORREL(<RANGE_OF_PERCENTAGE_COVERAGE>,<RANGE_OF_PERCENTAGE_BUGS_IN_NOT_COVERED>)
```

For `scripts/results_manually_processed.csv`, it looks like `=CORREL(E2:E13,G2:G13)`.
