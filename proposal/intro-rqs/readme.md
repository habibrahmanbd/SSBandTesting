## Introduction

Writing unit tests is a common practice in industry to ensure software quality. Usually meeting a certain criterea of test coverage serve as a segway to the product release. Despite all efforts, the software remains error prone. Empirical studies [1][2][3] at different scale and under different settings have found a no, weak or moderate correlation between coverage and test case. These studies examined all types of bugs that were found in the systems. A part of literature focusses on subset of bugs such as easy to fix one-line bugs, mostly in the context of program repair. However, There is a gap in study related to the effectiveness of test suites for such bugs. Previously there was no large dataset available to conduct such studies. The recent studies in automatic program fixing have produced large classified [4] and unclassified [5] datasets of one-line bugs.

In this study, we aim to fill the gap by studying the relation of unit testing and small one line bugs.
