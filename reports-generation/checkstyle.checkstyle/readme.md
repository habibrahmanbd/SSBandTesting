# Checkstyle

No `pom.xml` file provided. After analysis, it turned out to be an outlier. The part for which we were able to generate covered 40 bugs. All of them were in the non covered part. Which was understandable given it had 98% coverage. But it was acting as an outlier in affecting our results, so we skipped it.
