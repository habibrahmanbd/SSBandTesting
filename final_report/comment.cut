We would like to thank Sarah Nadi for her guidance and teaching us the necessary skills for this project. We would also like to acknowledge the CMPUT501 TAs, Batyr and Henry, for their assistance during lab sessions and helping us understand different technologies. Additionally, we note that this research was conducted while we were students at the University of Alberta.
